How Camunda8 form-js playground handles dynamic lists. 



I want to make my own custom element for camunda forms

I started by downloading this ===>>> https://github.com/bpmn-io/form-js-examples/tree/master/custom-components

And i followed the example of how to make a custom range element. 

My ultimate goal is I wanted to create a dynamic list with a maximum of 5 elements. 

Their dynamic list can add elements to the list by dragging the element over the top. 

here you can see the default dynamic list being used. 



ive tried to recreate the dynamic list. But I'm not saure how they handle adding new elements to the list. 



How are elements added to a dynamic list? what functions are used or what may i be missing?

I imagine I might need to add stuff to my CustomPropertiesProvider.js but im just not sure what?

Here is my current project in case anyone is capable of helping.
